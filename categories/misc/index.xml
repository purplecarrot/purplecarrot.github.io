&lt;p>When I bought my current house, it had a very old shed in the garden. So old, that the wooden floor was completely rotten through and the sides were also rotting away. It was surprising that it had not fallen down already. So I had to break it up to take it away. Whilst dismantling the shelves that the previous owner had put inside, I noticed some funny dark coloured and finely sanded wood that had been used to make the shelf supports. Then I found this label on one piece:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://purplecarrot.co.uk/images/posts/BairdTelevisionReceiver604.png" alt="Baird Television Receiver 605">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It says &lt;em>The Baird Television Receiver Model 604&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Instrument No. 43784.&lt;/em> So I've obviously heard of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logie_Baird">John Logie Baird&lt;/a> but I never remember seeing TVs in the shops made by a manufacturer called Baird. So the previous owner of my house, obviously decided to finally upgrade his Baird Model 604, and then recycle Â it to make shelves in his shed. Makes me wonder how I could have used my old CRT when I replaced it How resourceful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having recently read that Samsung alone sells 2 TVs per a second, and 48million TVs per year are sold in the US, I quite like having the last piece of &lt;em>Instrument No. 43784&lt;/em>. Much to my wife's annoyance, I will be keeping this old piece of wood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2011/04/27/first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2011 21:06:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2011/04/27/first-post/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Memory not as good as it used to be. Need to stop recording things in text files in my homedir and put them here where I can find them next time. Hopefully they may help you too.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
