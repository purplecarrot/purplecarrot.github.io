I've been working with various Linux systems since the late 1990s, primarily focussed on infrastucture development and system automation, with an interest in networking and containerizing applications (before they were called that!). This started with an enviroment of shells scripts and Perl running on Slackware Linux and proprietary UNIX systems, passed through various technologies from custom IaaS solution, to indepth periods with Ansible and OpenStack, and through to Python on modern RedHat Linux systems and containers.<br>

I have spent most of my career working for employers who were extremely keen on security, meaning that I can never share most of my work, and it is only able to be documented on internal wikis and document storage systems that are only accessible to employees of that organization - and even then, most of that is only available to a subset of the organzation.<br>

With much of the work I do day to day, I find issues and solutions that I later see blog posts on the same subject months or sometimes years later. So, I've decided to start documenting a few of these things myself on my own blog (taking extreme care to make sure nothing is inadvertently leaked!).
