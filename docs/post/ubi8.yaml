What is the RedHat Universal Binary Image, and should you be using it?

Advantages of Using UBI8 in OpenShift

One of the reasons you might want to use UBI8 is a high level of compatibility with worker nodes operating system. For example, if you build an application using UBI8 for running on OCP4.x, you’ll know your application is using Linux libraries that are compatible with, and widely tested with, those libraries and the kernel of the worker node host running your containers. At first, this might seem a little pedantic.
