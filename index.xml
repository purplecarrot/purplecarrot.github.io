&lt;p>Of course, this really shouldn't happen right? You're a responsible IT professional, and your OpenShift cluster is configured with multiple authentication methods, and a secure backup of a &lt;code>kubeconfig&lt;/code> file with the system:admin user certificates for passwordless login? Except sometimes it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my day job, we have a small lab OCP cluster running on vSphere that might not get used for weeks or sometimes months. The OpenShift nodes that make up the OCP cluster sometimes get automatically powered down and left off in that powered off state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday, I came to use this cluster for the first time again after quite a long period and found that I was unable to login with a standard LDAP user account with cluster-admin credentials that I would normally use. In addition, my admin &lt;code>kubeconfig&lt;/code> (the one generated by openshift-installer for the original installation), had very old pre-rotation CA certs or something and hadn't been used for a while. Attempting to use it just gave x509 errors and so it seemed unusable. This has happened a couple of times now over the years, and I believe it's related to it being an IPI cluster and certificate rotation issues from the cluster being powered down for long periods. Before looking at the root cause, I'm just writing down the recovery procedure I used for next time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So with no standard OAUTH authentication method available, I went back trying to use the original kubeconfig from the installation of the cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span> $ export KUBECONFIG=auth/kubeconfig
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span> $ oc get nodes
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span> Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>To try and understand more about what was happening, I added &lt;code>--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true&lt;/code>, and the &lt;code>--loglevel=10&lt;/code> options to the command line, but I could see that a goroutine stack trace was immediately output after the x509 error message above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As any experienced senior engineer will know, the first place to go for solving any technical problem is a good Google or StackOverflow search. Unfortunately StackOverflow threw up a lot of articles that were old, or weren't quite right and not what I was looking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unsurprisingly - this being OpenShift - the best results were found in the &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/search/#/">RedHat Knowledgebase&lt;/a>. The KB articles &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4505101">error: x509 certificate signed by unknown authority when logging in OpenShift 4 using the installation kubeconfig file&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5286371">How to re create kubeconfig from scratch for system:admin user in OpenShift 4&lt;/a> looked promising, but both required existing access to the cluster to recreate them, which I didn't have because standard authentication methods were not working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I knew that all the certs I needed were on the cluster nodes themselves, but these systems were running RedHat CoreOS. RedHat CoreOS is based on RedHat Enterprise Linux, but designed very much as an appliance. It's not expected to be managed by a human sysadmin - it has disabled root account, doesn't allow passwordless logins and its OS configuration is managed by the MachineConfigOperator function of OpenShift. The next problem was that (for reasons of this being a lab and the cluster being built by a colleague) the SSH key for the coreos user used for the installation wasn't available to me either :-) I did however, have access to the vSphere console of these VMS. There was no option, I had break my way in and get those certs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing was to boot the system to single user, reset the root password so I could login on the console. I've done this thousands of times over the years on many different versions of Linux and flavours of Linux, but interestingly this was more complicated on CoreOS (because of the way CoreOS works, and so it's not normally required). However, I did eventually get in and then I was able to locate the files I needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So all the secrets needed to run kube-apiserver are found in &lt;code>/etc/kubenetes/static-pod-resources/kube-apiserver-certs&lt;/code>. In particular, the node-kubeconfigs/ directory has mulitple kubeconfig files, one of which was called &lt;code>lb-int.kubeconfig&lt;/code>. When I set my KUBECONFIG environment variable to point to this file, I was then able to issue oc commands to the cluster:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span> # cd /etc/kubenetes/static-pod-resources/kube-apiserver-certs/secrets/node-kubeconfigs
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span> # export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/lb-int.kubeconfig
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span> # oc get nodes
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span> &amp;lt;lots of nodes with STATUS NotReady&amp;gt;
&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span> # oc get pods -A | grep -e Running
&lt;span class="ln">6&lt;/span> &amp;lt;lots of pods in ContainerCreating or Pending
&lt;span class="ln">7&lt;/span> # oc get csr -o name | xargs oc adm certificate approve
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I found that half the nodes were in state &lt;code>NotReady&lt;/code>, and so the oauth-openshift containers were not &lt;code>Running&lt;/code>. This in turn was because there were a bunch of unapproved CSRs. Once these were approved, the nodes became &lt;code>Ready&lt;/code> and the OAuth authentication pods were able to start up and the cluster recovered itself in the usual way. I was then able to login normally again and recreate a backup &lt;code>kubeconfig&lt;/code>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Does Alpine resolve DNS properly?</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/post/2021-09-04_does_alpine-resolve_dns_properly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 08:51:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/post/2021-09-04_does_alpine-resolve_dns_properly/</guid><description>
&lt;p>To anybody who has ever used containers, Alpine is a well known base operating system layer to many popular and widely used container images in use today. By design, it's a cut down minimal OS layer using the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.busybox.net/">busybox&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl libc&lt;/a> C library. By using these alternatives to GNU Coreutils and GNU glibc C Library, it provides a base OS container layer that allows you to build and run very small Linux containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week I was asked to look at a problem where an application team could not resolve a key DNS name used on our internal network when running their application within the container - their first thought was a problem with the OpenShift/Kubernetes environment where the container was running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the company I work for doesn't like us to disclose internal proprietary network information, so for the purposes of the post, let's say the DNS name being queried is &lt;code>vis.company.com&lt;/code> (very important service). All IPs and some other data in the extracts below have been manually changed to private RFC1918 addresses or redacted too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="basic-troubleshooting">Basic Troubleshooting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing to do was to perform my own DNS lookup of &lt;code>vis.company.com&lt;/code>. This worked fine from both my Linux workstation and Windows laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now what made this problem interesting was that the application running in the container was able to resolve all other DNS entries that it was required to in order to function(eg &lt;code>a.company.com&lt;/code>, &lt;code>b.company.com&lt;/code>), but it couldn't resolve this one crucial DNS entry &lt;code>vis.company.com&lt;/code>. When you connected to a shell running inside the container and ran &lt;code>getent hosts vis.company.com&lt;/code> it simply returned nothing at all, and exited with exit code 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="inside-the-container">Inside the Container&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So how do you go about troubleshooting a problem like this from within a container? In a standard OS, you can simply use the standard tools in your sysadmin toolkit - ss (lsof/netstat), dig, strace, tcpdump, nmap, etc - but inside a container these are unlikely to be available by default (and some containers don't even include a minimal unix shell even). I have a pre-built container I use for situations like this that I then add as a sidecar in the pod I'm troubleshooting. Then by setting &lt;code>shareProcessNamespace: true&lt;/code> in the podspec, it will allow you to easily debug and strace processes running inside the first container from the sidecar.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dns-query">DNS Query&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So strace'ing the DNS queries I could see the &lt;code>socket()&lt;/code> and &lt;code>bind()&lt;/code> calls, followed by receiving a response from the DNS server. However, this response was empty. Something weird was happening, because running the same command on a standard Linux host you could see 100s of lines more of system calls and a good DNS response with multiple A records was returned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the next step was to use tcpdump and capture a packet trace of the DNS query. Below is the relevant section from that pcap that shows the DNS query:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>18:00:27.376761 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 32569, offset 0, flags [DF], proto UDP (17), length 68)
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span> 10.96.10.99.43507 &amp;gt; 10.96.0.10:domain: 19977+ A? vis.company.com. (40)
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>18:00:27.386585 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 24288, offset 0, flags [DF], proto UDP (17), length 79)
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span> 10.96.0.10.domain &amp;gt; 10.96.10.99.43507: 19977| 0/0/1 (51)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So what does this tell us?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>This is standard UDP DNS query (id 19977) to query the IPv4 record &lt;code>vis.company.com&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The DNS server response comes from &lt;code>10.96.0.10&lt;/code>, which is the Kubernetes &lt;code>Service&lt;/code> address for CoreDNS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A DNS response was received, but no DNS records were in it (&lt;code>0/0/1&lt;/code> = 0 answer records, 0 nameservers and 1 additional record which is the query address itself)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>|&lt;/code> character after the 19977 id indicates that the TC (TrunCation) bit is set on this packet.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The most interesting of these is the last. The TC bit is used when the DNS response the DNS server wants to send to the client is longer than the 512bytes available to it in a UDP packet (see &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035">RFC1035&lt;/a> for more information.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a signal to the DNS resolver client that it needs to switch from a standard UDP DNS query and do a new TCP DNS query instead - but in both the strace and tcpdump output of the application running the the Alpine container, the resolver query exited immediate after receiving this TC UDP packet from the DNS server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I expected this to be a bug, but it turned out that this is a &lt;a href="https://wiki.musl-libc.org/functional-differences-from-glibc.html">functional difference between musl libc and glibc&lt;/a> and is by design. The musl libc author states that he intentionally didn't support TCP as felt it would be better for performance and UX reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">My choice not to do TCP in musl&amp;#39;s stub resolver was based on an interpretation that truncated results are not just acceptable but better ux - not only do you save major round-trip delays to DNS but you also get a reasonable upper bound on # of addrs in result.&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Rich Felker (@RichFelker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RichFelker/status/994629795551031296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2018&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>This is true, and a valid point. However, it means that this particular app would never work when running in a container based on Alpine. Sometimes predictable functionality is more important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are various other ways this could have been made to work. Perhaps making the DNS entry smaller - which was indeed unnecessarily large - would indeed be a better fix, but unfortunately this wasn't a practical option as the DNS entry wasn't under this team's control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, the quickest fix was to rebuild the application into a new container image using the RedHat UBI8 image as a base layer instead of Alpine. This image uses glibc resolver, and then the app then ran fine, in the same way as it did on the RedHat Linux 8 host where it had ran before being containerized.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Practical Tekton</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/post/2020-09-12-tekton_and_knative/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 10:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/post/2020-09-12-tekton_and_knative/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This post gives an overview of Tekton based on my initial testing and exploration of the project within a RedHat OpenShift (Kubernetes) cluster (using v4.4 and v4.5)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goal was to explore the new technologies to see if I could simplify the developer experience for our developers and users. A simple task: to take a VS Code commit (running on Windows 10 desktop I used in my day job), trigger a pipeline to build the application into a container image, run unit tests and vulnerability scanning, and then deploy the application image to the OpenShift cluster using KNative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that Tekton is known as OpenShift Pipelines in OpenShift, and KNative is known as OpenShift Serverless. They're essentially the same thing, and I may use those terms interchangably in this document.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm not going to cover installation of Tekton or KNative here, because there are plenty of documents out there that already cover it, both in vanilla Kubernetes clusters and OpenShift clusters. In any case with OpenShift versions of these products, it's relatively easy to install using the Operators feature found in OpenShift.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-tekton">What is Tekton?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tekton is a tool for creating CI/CD application container build pipelines within Kubernetes. Tekton is &lt;em>kubernetes-native&lt;/em>, meaning it was designed from the ground up as a CI/CD system running directly inside a Kubernetes cluster. It is implemented using various CRDs (&lt;code>Pipeline, PipelineRun, Tasks, ClusterTasks, Triggers, etc&lt;/code>) provided under &lt;code>tekton.dev&lt;/code> and &lt;code>triggers.tekton.dev&lt;/code> API groups. As such, if you're experienced Kubernetes user and comfortable with applying, patching and editing the YAML of Kubernetes resources, you'll be right at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pipelines-tasks-and-steps">Pipelines, Tasks and Steps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To deploy a Tekton CI/CD pipeline, you start of by creating a &lt;code>Pipeline&lt;/code> YAML resources which consists of a number of &lt;code>Tasks&lt;/code>. Each &lt;code>Task&lt;/code> in the &lt;code>Pipeline&lt;/code> gets deployed as its own pod within the namespace, and is made up of a series of steps, which each step being a separate container image in the pod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, for example if you have a &lt;code>Task&lt;/code> with three build, push, scan steps, a single pod with three different container images is normally deployed. In addition, Tekton itself adds init containers and other things to the pod in order to execute the pipeline (for example, the pipelines-creds-init-rhel8 init container which setups secrets and any script resources specified in your tasks, etc). The order of execution of each &lt;code>Task&lt;/code> is determined by setting the &lt;code>spec.tasks[*].runAfter:&lt;/code> parameter, which can be used to ensure the Pipeline runs in a specific order (steps can also run in parallel by setting these to be the same on different &lt;code>Tasks&lt;/code>). Below is a fabricated example to illustrate this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="pipelineresources">PipelineResources&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is also a Tekton resource type called a &lt;code>PipelineResource&lt;/code>, which is an input or output object that can be defined as a &lt;code>spec.resource&lt;/code> and provided to a &lt;code>Task&lt;/code>. For example, you might have a Git Repo &lt;code>PipelineResource&lt;/code> input which defines a Git repo (url, branch) a Git clone type &lt;code>Task&lt;/code> can use as an input, or an output object for a container image output from a build &lt;code>Tasks&lt;/code> (eg &lt;code>$(resources.outputs.image.url)&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my experience with Tekton 0.7, these were hideously complicated to debug, I found them very opaque and hard to troubleshoot, and had compatability issues using them where they didn't fully support the auth mechanism of our container registry (JFrog Artifactory). In most cases using parameters was easier and just as functional, so I quickly stopped using PipelineResources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In additon, during OpenShift Pipelines version updates I noticed that more ClusterTasks were switching from using PipelineResouurces as inputs to using standard parameters as inputs (eg &lt;code>$(params.git_url&lt;/code>) instead of &lt;code>$(resources.inputs.git.url)&lt;/code>). There is a section of the Tetkon docs &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/resources.md#why-arent-pipelineresources-in-beta">Why Aren't PipelineResources in Beta?&lt;/a> which also suggests there have been issues, and so it appears that they are falling out of favour or at least need some more work. In any case, I've not found a compelling reason for using them over parameters.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="secrets">Secrets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When using &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code> with Tekton it is worth noting that in comparison to others users of &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code>. Tekton is very particular about their type and annotations. Most of our &amp;quot;Git secrets&amp;quot; (&lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code> containing private SSH keys that are attached to &lt;code>BuildConfigs&lt;/code>) were initially created as &lt;code>type: Opaque&lt;/code>. Whilst this allows them to be used with &lt;code>BuildConfigs&lt;/code>, they are not picked up and used with Tekton. To use them, you will need to ensure the &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code> type is set to &lt;code>type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, Tekton secrets must have annotations that explictly define hosts where they will be used. Lastly, a &lt;code>data.known_hosts&lt;/code> (which you can get from $HOME/.ssh/know_hosts after you've connected to it via SSH) is also required to avoid error messages. The example below shows an example of a correctly annotated SSH key &lt;code>Secret&lt;/code> for use with Tekton.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span class="ln"> 1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">apiVersion&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">:&lt;/span>&lt;span class="w"> &lt;/span>&lt;span class="l">v1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="w">

&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="workspaces">Workspaces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Workspaces were introduced into Tekton as a new feature whilst I was working on it. They're kind of like standard &lt;code>Volumes&lt;/code> in a Pod in that they present &lt;code>Secrets&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ConfigMaps&lt;/code> or &lt;code>PersistentVolumeClaims&lt;/code> into a location in the filesystem of a given &lt;code>Task's&lt;/code> pod. I only used a &lt;code>PVC&lt;/code> in my testing. The value of this is that you can share data between tasks (eg the source code your application build task needs after it has cloned from your git clone task).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="running-a-pipeline">Running a Pipeline&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you execute a &lt;code>Pipeline&lt;/code> a &lt;code>PipelineRun&lt;/code> object is created that connects the &lt;code>Workspace&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ServiceAccounts&lt;/code>, &lt;code>Pipelines&lt;/code> etc together and deploys the Pods needed to run your &lt;code>Pipeline&lt;/code> - or in other words, there is one &lt;code>PipelineRun&lt;/code> object created for each time the &lt;code>Pipeline&lt;/code> is executed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As all Tekton objects are implemented natively in Kubernetes as CRDs, you could just use oc/kubectl to use Tekton, but using tkn CLI client is much easier (in OpenShift, you can also use the Web Console UI, navigate Pipelines menu then simply click Start in the context menu) for interacting and using Tekton pipelines. For example, to start your pipeline run the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>tkn start mypipeline
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>By default, tkn will go into an interactive mode and prompt you to enter all the input information it requires. But I quickly got into the habit of passing these all as additional command line parameters, and immediately displaying any logs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>tkn pipeline start mypipeline --user-param-defaults -w name=workspace,claimName=workspace --showlog
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Though I have been using OpenShift and Kubernetes for quite a few years, I was new to both KNative and Tekton. Both are fast moving projects, with many resources in alpha or beta (RedHat Tech Preview) at best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with any new software, it can be a little tricky to workout and understand how it all integrates together. This is particulary true in a company like the one where I work where we run OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters in a more secure, disconnected, on-premise environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, we tend to run with on-prem instances of commercial products (eg JFrog Artifactory Container Registry) instead of cloud or externally hosted service (like Docker Hub or Quay.io). Even though these services run on a private disconnected network, we are also required to adhere to stricter security policies than most organisations (eg never public open access Git repos or registries, always requiring credentials for any type of pull or push, using private CAs and PKI). This means being an early adopter of new software- that developers and testers have developed with standard cloud services out on the internet rather than on-prem commerical products - you're likely to encounter more bugs for the first time using new projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The table below shows the versions I've been using, and each version fixed bugs I'd actually seen myself in the prior version. I can't stress enough that if you're an OpenShift or non-cloud Kubernetes user where you manage the versions, use both the latest OpenShift and Pipeline versions.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>The other thing with new alpha/beta software is that it changes quite quickly, and this means that many of the articles, tutorials, GitHub comments and issues reference objects that have been deprecated or now have a new &lt;code>spec:&lt;/code> or something (for example one of the prominent Serverless tutorials still in the top of Google searchs as I write this even details the KNative build component, which has now been deprecated in favour of Tekton in a separate project). Be very careful using older examples and tutorials found on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, after a few teething issues I got a working Python pipeline where I built, scanned and deployed a Python container image as a Knative service and I can say I really like Tekton. In particular, I never really enjoyed writing Groovy and much prefer creating pipelines from combination of bash scripts and YAML editing of Kubernetes resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my next post, I will detail how I'm using KNative (Serverless) as a lightweight way to deploy your application at the end of the Pipeline. Knative promises lots, but its use in development and build systems is a solid use case that can easily be used today.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Verifying TLS certificates in Python</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/post/archive/2015-12-03-verifying-tls-certificates-in-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 18:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/post/archive/2015-12-03-verifying-tls-certificates-in-python/</guid><description>
&lt;p>All too often people I see Python code using the requests module to query an API that just bypass TLS verification (i.e it sets &lt;code>verify=False&lt;/code> in the requests function calls). On RedHat Linux and derivatives, you can simply set this to &lt;code>verify=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt&lt;/code> and your Python code will then automatically use any system CA certs are part of TLS verification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If like me, the environment you work in has a private Root CA that even requires and issues certs to internal services on an internal private network, you can really easily add this root CA cert (and any intermediate CA certs you might want to trust) to the systems cert chain:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="c1"># cp mycompany-root-ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>&lt;span class="c1"># /usr/bin/update-ca-trust&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But perhaps you work on regulated systems where you don't have privileged root access? In that case, you can set the shell environment variable &lt;code>REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$HOME/mycert.crt&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can relate to the fact that sometimes we just want to get the code written as quickly as possible, but it doesn't have to be difficult and it's worth getting in the habit of leaving TLS verification turned on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating a RPM changelog using git log</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/11/19/generating-rpm-changelog-from-git-log/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 16:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/11/19/generating-rpm-changelog-from-git-log/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I use python setuptools bdist_rpm to build RPMs from the code in my git repositories and today I updated my automated build script (a wrapper around python setup.py to run pre-requisite functions) to generate an RPM changelog from the git log of the repository hosting the package and then automatically include this in the rpm being built. A search on github shows there are a few python scripts and pypi modules to do this, but I wondered if I could just use git log.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems you can. The &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Changelogs">Fedora packaging&lt;/a> describe the format of the changelog file. They also appear to recommend not using your vcs changelog as your changelog messages would be too terse for the users. However, in my case they're not and it's exactly what they want&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With git log you can use the --pretty option to format the output of the commit log. You select the appropriate formats from git &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats">pretty-formats&lt;/a> to make it output the git log in RPM changelog format. Unfortunately though, none of the date formats available are quite the correct format for an RPM changelog. It expects just the date of the change and doesn't want (nor can it handle) the time or the timezone offset of the git commit. The way I addressed this was to pipe the git log output through perl to remove those date fields. It would be nicer if git log had date +%H:%M:%S type formatting, but it doesn't, so we add the perl oneliner with a suitable regex to remove the parts we don't want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also rpm-build (or perhaps setuptools) doesn't like any blank lines in the changelog file, so we remove those with perl -00 option. The contents of the generated changelog file (not the filename) are then passed into the setup.py --changelog option. The double quotes ensure the whitespace is preserved.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>$ git log --pretty&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;tformat:* %cd %an &amp;lt;%ae&amp;gt; (%h)%n- %s%b%n&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="se">\

&lt;p>We have recently recruited lots of new staff at the firm where I work and they are all learning git for the first time (and believe it or not, for many, it is their first experience of any VCS). I was surprised today when one of these new staff approached me because he had lost a couple of hours work!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The remote HEAD had changed quite a bit since his initial checkout, and he got himself into a bit of a mess pulling down changes and merging his local changes. To further compound the error, he did a git reset --hard HEAD~3, and then tried a few different git revert and git reset commands to get it into the state he wanted! He asked me if there was an easy way to get these back (after he read git reset --hard is permanent and dangerous!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we've all lost work at some point in our lives, but I've never managed to actually &lt;em>lose&lt;/em> work in DVCS. Fortunately, I remembered a git tutorial a while back where they had talked about the reflog. So I knew his commit was &amp;quot;there somewhere&amp;quot;, it just needed to be got back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out this is actually very simple. You simply view your reflog and then hard reset back to the commit SHA you want (I had to update the output below as it contains proprietary information from my firm!)&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln"> 1&lt;/span>$ git reflog
&lt;span class="ln"> 2&lt;/span>a30a408 HEAD@&lt;span class="o">{&lt;/span>0&lt;span class="o">}&lt;/span>: commit: Revert &lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;XYZ&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln"> 3&lt;/span>4149dbf HEAD@&lt;span class="o">{&lt;/span>1&lt;span class="o">}&lt;/span>: commit: 4149dbf.... updating HEAD
&lt;span class="ln"> 4&lt;/span>a6b3b59 HEAD@&lt;span class="o">{&lt;/span>2&lt;span class="o">}&lt;/span>: commit: a6b3b59.... updating HEAD
&lt;span class="ln"> 5&lt;/span>957745c HEAD@&lt;span class="o">{&lt;/span>3&lt;span class="o">}&lt;/span>: HEAD~2: updating HEAD
&lt;span class="ln"> 6&lt;/span>daa6d14 HEAD@&lt;span class="o">{&lt;/span>4&lt;span class="o">}&lt;/span>: HEAD~3: updating HEAD
&lt;span class="ln"> 7&lt;/span>ebc7042 HEAD@&lt;span class="o">{&lt;/span>5&lt;span class="o">}&lt;/span>: pull: Merge made by recursive
&lt;span class="ln"> 8&lt;/span>635d7ff HEAD@&lt;span class="o">{&lt;/span>6&lt;span class="o">}&lt;/span>: commit: Last Good Commit
&lt;span class="ln"> 9&lt;/span>$ git reset --hard 635d7ff
&lt;span class="ln">10&lt;/span>$ git push -f
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So these reset commits are basically in the reflog as garbage. This revert could be done immediately, but these garbage commits will eventually be deleted (configuration variable gc.reflogExpire which defaults to 90 days). So you won't always be able to go back to them, but it is good for immediate recovery of errors, which is realistically the case when you will be able to use this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fedora 22, Wayland and Multiple Monitors</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/09/24/fedora-22-wayland-and-multiple-monitors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 20:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/09/24/fedora-22-wayland-and-multiple-monitors/</guid><description>
&lt;p>By default, a new Fedora installation or a fedup upgrade on my dual monitor machine will result in GDM displaying the list of users and login screen on my left hand monitor. But I want it on my right hand monitor...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up until now, I simply logged in and set up the configuration I wanted using Settings -&amp;gt; Displays. Then I took the ~/.config/monitors.xml file that is generated and copied it to /var/lib/gdm/.config/monitors.xml ready for GDM to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, with Fedora 22, it appears that GDM is set to use Wayland, however once you login to a session, it continues to use X. This new Wayland config uses slightly different XML directives in the monitors.xml meaning a simple copy of your ~/.config/monitors.xml to /var/lib/gdm/.config/monitors.xml no longer works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To work around this, click on the cog and select GNOME on Wayland. Then setup the Displays as you need them and then copy the ~/.config/monitors.xml file (which will be in &amp;quot;Wayland&amp;quot; format) again to /var/lib/gdm/.config/monitors.xml and restart GDM (there may be a better way, but I switch to a virtual console and do init 3 followed by init 5)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then your GDM login screen will be correctly setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>UPDATE 20151008: After upgrading to latest rpm set last night, this is now broken again and GDM is displaying the login on the monitor I don't want it to be on. I verified the monitors.xml file for gdm was correct, but for some reason gdm doesn't appear to be honoring it. Not being something I want to investigate, I decided to just disable Wayland for the moment by adding the WaylandEnable=False /etc/gdm/custom.conf :-)&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Debugging Flask applications running under Apache mod_wsgi</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/07/21/debugging-flask-applications-running/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 10:46:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/07/21/debugging-flask-applications-running/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I have recently been developing a new python web application that uses the Flask framework. Whilst running standalone, it was working fine. Then I went to setup the UAT environment which is running under Apache using mod_wsgi. I've done this many times before without any problems. However, this time I was getting a &amp;quot;500 Internal Server Error&amp;quot; in my browser. I opened up the Apache error_log expecting a stack trace error in there that will pinpoint where my typo or forgotten config option that I need to fix is, but no. Nothing. It just said &amp;quot;Loading WSGI script&amp;quot; and implied everything was working ok.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I read that mod_wsgi discards all stdout and as I realised my error was early in the startup process, I wasn't able to see the error message or stack trace I needed to debug the problem. To see this error, you can add basic logging to stderr in your WSGI script to send the missing errors to stderr and therefore on to Apache error_log. In my case the error was simply an IOError exception because of a missing file I had forgot to copy over (yes, I will add that to my tests!)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are many different file formats and file extensions for storing certificates. It seems each time I come around to renewing a cert, I have forgetten what all the files and extensions mean. So for next time... Certificates are generally encoded in either Base64, PEM, or DEM formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Base64 (.cer)&lt;/strong>
Originally developed for use with S/MIME (the first?) and the most widely supported format. More likely to be issued by Certificate Authorities that run on Linux. A base64 encoded certificate can be opened in vi and will start with &amp;quot;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----&amp;quot; and end with &amp;quot;-----END CERTIFICATE-----&amp;quot; with the BASE64 encoded data in the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PEM - Privacy Enhanced Mail (.pem,.crt, .key, .cer)&lt;/strong>
The PEM format is the most common format that CAs issue certificates in. They are ASCII and also BASE64 encoded and end and start with the same &amp;quot;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;-----END CERTIFICATE-----&amp;quot; Certificates, certificate chains and private keys can be put into and distributed in PEM format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DER - Distinguished Encoding Rules (.der, but also .cer or .crt)&lt;/strong>
This is actually the same as PEM but whereas PEM is Base64 ASCII, DER is a binary form of the certificate and it does not have the BEGIN/END statements. DER format supports storage of a single certificate, but can't be used for storing a private key or certificate chain. DER format is typically seen with java based platforms and applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PFX - Personal Information Exchange (.pfx)&lt;/strong>
The PFX format (also known as PKCS #12) is a format that stores multiple certificates and private keys in one file. They are typically used on Windows machines to facilitate import and exports. They can be readily converted to the other formats&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PKCS#7 (.p7b)&lt;/strong>
Allows storage of certificates and certificate chains but not private keys and commonly used by Certicate Authorities to provide certificate chains to clients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing OpenStack Hooks</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/04/23/writing-openstack-hooks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2015 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/04/23/writing-openstack-hooks/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I've recently been writing OpenStack Nova hooks for integration of newly deployed OpenStack nova instances with our existing infrastructure systems. Though the &lt;a href="http://developer.openstack.org/">OpenStack Developer Documentation&lt;/a> is very good, there is not that much documentation out there on real world end-user experiences of writing nova hooks. In this post, I will document my experiences in writing a nova hook for the first time and may be it will help others approaching the same task.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary-and-goals">Summary and Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Linux or Windows VMs provisioned by OpenStack for use in my firm must be registered with a number of other &amp;quot;Enterprise&amp;quot; systems external to the OpenStack core components. For example, an inventory system, an LDAP directory, a separate corporate IPAM solution (DNS) as well as security audit systems. Generally, the key for recording this data in the external system is either the new instance's hostname, IP address or mac address. This integration must be done at the point of instance/vm creation or deletion (because in some cases the registration event must occur before the new instance has booted) and so OpenStack nova hooks work well for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-openstack-hooks">What are OpenStack Hooks?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OpenStack hooks allow you - as the system integrator - to write custom python code to execute any business logic or custom logic and then have this code execute when the relevant OpenStack function is called.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You write your code as a standard python module and using setuptools for packaging and deployment, just as if you were writing any other python module. You then simply define entry points and your code will get executed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your code can be setup to run either before the hooked function (pre hook) or after (post hook) the hooked function. At the time of writing, nova only has a handful of hooks declared but I would imagine that in time hooks will be declared across many more methods and across many OpenStack components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently with the version of OpenStack I'm working with, you could add custom code to be run on nova create_instance, delete_instance or resize_instance method and this would get executed when that method is called internally as part of those nova processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You then create your package and define the methods you want to get called alongside the OpenStack nova methods where you want them to run. Here is an example of the setup.py binding custom package methods to nova create and delete instances:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setuppy">setup.py&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The code is actually very simple indeed. You add the code you want to run inside the post of pre method of the class. Because this code runs inside nova-api, you have access to lots of information inside the args and kwargs passed into the function which can be used inside your code. For example, the uuid, name, flavor and much more are all available with very little efforts for your code to use.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="scale">Scale&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There isn't much information out there on customising OpenStack workflow like this. There is lots of information about using ansible, puppet, chef and similar tools for &lt;em>post&lt;/em> build configuration of the operating system inside instance, but less information on running code that you want to run on behalf of the instance, but which cannot or you do not wish to run inside the instance. However, it should be noted that code running inside the post hook will block and/or error the instance creation. It maybe that a message bus approach would scale better with a short simple hook that puts a message on a bus and a secondary daemon running on the system that consumes and acts on that message and I may look at implementing that in future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you develop python modules for distribution, you likely use python setuptools. It's very useful and takes lots of the manual operations out of distributing python code and modules. I recently started going one step further and using the bdist_rpm setup.py command option to automatically build rpms for my python code and modules too. Unfortunately, I found a bug (on RHEL 6 version of setuptools at least) in that it doesn't appear the install_requires directive in setup.py is being read or used correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After adding &lt;em>install_requires=['requests']&lt;/em> to the setup.py file, the rpm spec file that &lt;em>python setup.py bdist_rpm&lt;/em> created did &lt;strong>NOT&lt;/strong> include the correct &lt;em>Requires:&lt;/em> line required to include the dependency in the RPM. I experimented with the argument supplied (eg python-requests/requests) and other such things, but was not able to build an RPM with the dependencies on the python-requests RPM that I wanted to include.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some playing and research, I was finally able to get it to generate an RPM with the correct dependency on python-requests by creating and using this custom setup.cfg file:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>cat &lt;span class="s">&amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF &amp;gt; setup.cfg
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">[bdist_rpm]
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">requires = python-requests &amp;gt;= 1.1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">no-autoreq = yes
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">EOF&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">6&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The other line in there (&lt;em>no-autoreq&lt;/em>) tells setup.py not to analyse your code for dependencies and include those in the RPM too. I added this because by default, the generated RPM had tied a dependency to python 2.6 (RHEL 6) but I wanted an RPM generated that would run on python 2.7 (RHEL 7) too so adding this flag removes any dependency on a specific python version&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Build a Python Version Agnostic RPM For Your Python Module</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/04/02/build-rpm-for-your-python-module/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 15:52:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2015/04/02/build-rpm-for-your-python-module/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I often use the python setup.py bdist_rpm command on RHEL to build RPMs of the python modules I'm developing. This makes it easy for me to distribute my module via the yum repos internally at the company I work for. At my company, most of our production servers are currently RHEL 6, but we are starting to deploy RHEL 7. When I took one of my recently built RPMs of a python module (that runs under python 2.6 and python 2.7), I was surprised to find that it did not install on RHEL7 because of missing dependencies. It turns out, that my RPMs &amp;quot;required&amp;quot; python 2.6 from RHEL 6 (RHEL 7 moves to python 2.7 as default). &amp;lt;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>$ rpm -qpR python-mymodule-2.8-1.noarch.rpm
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>/usr/bin/python
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>python&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>abi&lt;span class="o">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> 2.6
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>python-requests
&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span>rpmlib&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>CompressedFileNames&lt;span class="o">)&lt;/span> &amp;lt;&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> 3.0.4-1
&lt;span class="ln">6&lt;/span>rpmlib&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>PayloadFilesHavePrefix&lt;span class="o">)&lt;/span> &amp;lt;&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> 4.0-1
&lt;span class="ln">7&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Even though I don't have a specific version of python listed in the requirements for the package, the rpmbuild called by setuptools automatically adds a dependency on the python version installed on the system I'm using. This is because when rpmbuild scans through my source, it then finds the shebang that points to #!/usr/bin/env python, which in turn finds the python 3.6 on the server where I build the RPM. Obviously, I could rebuild the rpm on a RHEL 7 host and it would then find python 2.7, but I don't want to have separate RPMs for different RHEL versions when the code is the same. I wanted to be able to produce an RPM for my python module and code that installs and runs on RHEL 6 and RHEL 7 (when the python code is tested to run under python 2.6+) Now this isn't particularly well documented, but I did a little digging and found that to do this, you can simply add the --no-autoreq option to setup.py&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>$ python setup.py bdist_rpm --no-autoreq
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will then tell bdist_rpm to add the &amp;quot;AutoReq: no&amp;quot; option to the spec file used to generate the RPM. RPM build will then see this and the resulting RPM will then no longer require a specific version of python.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>$ rpm -qpR python-mymodule-2.8-2.noarch.rpm
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>python-requests
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>rpmlib&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>CompressedFileNames&lt;span class="o">)&lt;/span> &amp;lt;&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> 3.0.4-1
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>rpmlib&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>PayloadFilesHavePrefix&lt;span class="o">)&lt;/span> &amp;lt;&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> 4.0-1
&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can then add the option to your setup.cfg file for the module, so that you don't forget it next time and inadvertently distribute a python version dependent module. &amp;lt;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">[&lt;/span>bdist_rpm&lt;span class="o">]&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Generally, if I have 100 files that I need to edit and make changes in, I tend to write a perl or python script to make them (if I have 3 files, I just open them in VIM and make them manually!) Yesterday however, a colleague who doesn't code had to change 2 consecutive lines in about 400 similar files and wanted a simple &amp;quot;one liner&amp;quot; type way to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This perl one liner is what I gave him. It allows replacement of multi line text with another piece of multiline text, in place, in the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln"> 1&lt;/span>$ cat example.conf
&lt;span class="ln"> 2&lt;/span>Line1
&lt;span class="ln"> 3&lt;/span>Line2
&lt;span class="ln"> 4&lt;/span>Line3
&lt;span class="ln"> 5&lt;/span>Line4
&lt;span class="ln"> 6&lt;/span>$ perl -i -la0pe &lt;span class="s1">&amp;#39;~s/Line2\nLine3/ReplaceLine2\nReplaceLine3/g&amp;#39;&lt;/span> example.conf
&lt;span class="ln"> 7&lt;/span>$ cat example.conf
&lt;span class="ln"> 8&lt;/span>Line1
&lt;span class="ln"> 9&lt;/span>ReplaceLine2
&lt;span class="ln">10&lt;/span>ReplaceLine3
&lt;span class="ln">11&lt;/span>Line4
&lt;span class="ln">12&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It's then easy to use shell script to loop around all the files in a directory and run this command. If you're nervous, it's best to first check what your changes do by perhaps piping the file through perl.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>$ cat example.conf &lt;span class="p">|&lt;/span> perl -la0pe &lt;span class="s1">&amp;#39;~s/Line2\nLine3/ReplaceLine2\nReplaceLine3/g&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>$ cat example.conf
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>Line1
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>ReplaceLine2
&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span>ReplaceLine3
&lt;span class="ln">6&lt;/span>Line4
&lt;span class="ln">7&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Another idea is also to use the -i.bak option to make backup files so you have a copy of the files before the edits ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Minecraft GNOME Desktop Icon</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2014/10/07/minecraft/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 18:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2014/10/07/minecraft/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I had an email about the minecraft.desktop file in the config file in a previous post. My kids love to play Minecraft, and installation of this simple GNOME .desktop file gives them the launcher icon on their desktops.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When it comes to customising GNOME, its config has always confused me - gconf, dconf, gconf-edit, gconftool - what are they all for? The furthest I've ever delved into them was copying and pasting some tips (give me my minimize and maximize buttons back!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Linux work is almost exclusively with headless servers sitting in data centres I never see, so I've never taken the trouble to read or understand GNOME configuration. There has been lots of &lt;a href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_over_GNOME_3">controversy&lt;/a> over GNOME 3. I'm all for change, but if only the configuration of GNOME 3 was easy a little easier. Most options aren't available to set in the GUI control panel, but there are plenty of options to be set. Unfortunately they tend to be hidden away and it is not at all clear how to set common settings. In turn, because of GNOME changes between versions, googling GNOME config finds much inaccurate or at best, out of date information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was time to properly understand all these things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Forget gconftool, gconf-edit and scripts that sed gschema XML files (yes, there are some people sed'ing XML files out there!). For GNOME 3 on Fedora 20 (RHEL 7), there are two tools of interest: gsettings and dconf-editor
This is best illustrated by way of an example. Here is a list of common settings I put as default on my Fedora desktops. They should be pretty self-explanatory. The links below contain list of further configuration settings you can apply. I only wish these were more readily exposed in the GUI.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Subversion's &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; to store repository passwords in plain text files is a little scary. In my opinion, even a minimal obfuscation routine in the svn client would be better than saving a user's clear text password in text files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I obviously do not want to store my password in clear, so up until now, I've put up with typing my password in for each commit. But having recently created an automated packaging system for some software at work which uses multiple svn tags and copies, it was becoming tiresome having to repeatedly enter my password all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an alternative, Subversion supports using gnome-keyring-daemon to store the repository passwords but the servers I used don't have X or GNOME installed, but with a little bit of extra manual config, gnome-keyring-daemon can be used over SSH connections too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The subversion documentation on setting this up and using gnome-keyring-daemon with SSH from the terminal is pretty poor, and the suggestions on sites and blogs I found discussing the problem didn't work for me. However, after reading these sites and some trial and error, I did get it working. The steps below show what I did to get gnome-keyring-daemon and subversion working on a RHEL 6 server with standard RHEL repos:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First install the following core RPMs that are in the standard RHEL repositories:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>yum install gnome-keyring dbus-x11 subversion
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Next, add the following to your .bashrc or .bash_profile to setup gnome-keyring-daemon when you're not running GNOME or a desktop:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>eval `gnome-keyring-daemon`
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Edit subversion config files to use gnome-keyring for passwords: &lt;pre class="brush: shell">
~/.subversion/config
[auth]
password-stores = gnome-keyring&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~/.subversion/servers
[global]
store-passwords = yes
store-plaintext-passwords = no&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>Then when you do a subversion action for the first time you&amp;#39;ll get asked for GNOME keyring password, but subsequent actions will no longer prompt for password:
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>server01:~/svn/proj/trunk$ svn update
Updating '.':
Password for 'svn' GNOME keyring:
At revision 864&lt;/p>
&lt;p>server01:~/svn/proj/trunk$ svn -m &amp;quot;Test Auth&amp;quot; ci
Sending GNUmakefile
Transmitting file data .....
Committed revision 865.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>Sites that I found useful in getting this config working for me were the [Version Control with Subversion](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.confarea.html) book and [this blog post](http://technicalprose.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/using-subversion-with-gnome-keyring.html) describing a wrapper around svn and gnome-keyring that the author wrote to do the same.

&lt;p>When I bought my current house, it had a very old shed in the garden. So old, that the wooden floor was completely rotten through and the sides were also rotting away. It was surprising that it had not fallen down already. So I had to break it up to take it away. Whilst dismantling the shelves that the previous owner had put inside, I noticed some funny dark coloured and finely sanded wood that had been used to make the shelf supports. Then I found this label on one piece:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://purplecarrot.co.uk/images/posts/BairdTelevisionReceiver604.png" alt="Baird Television Receiver 605">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It says &lt;em>The Baird Television Receiver Model 604&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Instrument No. 43784.&lt;/em> So I've obviously heard of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logie_Baird">John Logie Baird&lt;/a> but I never remember seeing TVs in the shops made by a manufacturer called Baird. So the previous owner of my house, obviously decided to finally upgrade his Baird Model 604, and then recycle  it to make shelves in his shed. Makes me wonder how I could have used my old CRT when I replaced it How resourceful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having recently read that Samsung alone sells 2 TVs per a second, and 48million TVs per year are sold in the US, I quite like having the last piece of &lt;em>Instrument No. 43784&lt;/em>. Much to my wife's annoyance, I will be keeping this old piece of wood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configuring Out-Of-Band Management Interface from In-Band Server</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/10/11/configuring-out-of-band-management/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2013 16:43:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/10/11/configuring-out-of-band-management/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Most modern x86 servers include &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_management">out-of-band&lt;/a> Management or Lights-out Management systems. These systems offer remote configuration and remote console access to a headless server normally located in a datacenter. These are typically used when first setting up a server, or perhaps when the server is hosed. The company I work for is large enough to have dedicated server operators, and in my role I rarely if ever need to access the consoles of real devices. However, I recently needed to get to the console of a device and the server was in a different continent and timezone and I couldn't access the IP address I'd been emailed :( Not a good start to the day. I remember using ipmitool to configure OOB management before, but of course I never wrote down what I did then. As this blog is really a note taking memory aid system, I'm writing it down for next time. So using ipmitool I was able to determine the IP address of the server.&lt;/p>

What must have happen is that the server installation engineer had used a screen and keyboard on a trolley to configure the server, and then probably tested it from a device on the same subnet (I'm being generous here, as he/she may have never bothered testing it!)

&lt;p>Nearly all enterprise x86 servers include an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_management">out-of-band management interface&lt;/a> such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out">HP iLO&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Remote_Supervisor_Adapter">IBM RSA&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseboard_Management_Controller#Baseboard_management_controller">BMC&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI&lt;/a>, Dell DRAC, etc. These are used for remotely power cycling, monitoring and what the data centre ops guys, confusingly for me, call KVM access (that's Keyboard Video Mouse not Kernel Virtual Machine!)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well, it didn't strictly move anywhere but my broadband IP address changed after re-DHCP. I used to use no-ip.com, but then I no longer really host anything on my home network, so I figured could save myself 20 bucks as I didn't think I needed it anymore. Then I went to check in some old code to an old svn repo (that's another story) and of course it failed (and luckily for me, no bad guy had a repo sitting on the old ip!) Anyway, this is easily fixed by first checking the URL of the working copy and then switching it with the svn switch command:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just typing &amp;quot;What is my external ip address&amp;quot; into Google is normally the most convenient way to find your external public IP address when you're behind a NAT'd broadband connection. The site ipconfig.me offers an alternative and clean way to get it from the command line, for example for use in a shell script:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>server# curl ifconfig.me
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>132.231.56.65
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>server# curl ifconfig.me/host
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>132-231-56-65.myisp.com
&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>They have a range of options to return IP, Hostname, UserAgent, etc. The one I may be using is ifconfig.me/all.json or all.xml, to make it even easier to read into a Perl or Python script!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Named Groups in Python Regular Expressions</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/09/11/named-groups-in-python-regular/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 10:14:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/09/11/named-groups-in-python-regular/</guid><description>
&lt;p>To anybody working with Unix and Linux systems, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions&lt;/a> or regexes are extremely useful for fast pattern matching in scripts. First there were basic regexes now known as BREs as used by traditional Unix utilities like sed, and then came along the even more useful Perl Enhanced Regular Expressions. So useful were these, that many of the traditional GNU utilities in Linux were retrofitted with support for these Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (so ubiquitous are these PCREs now in GNU and OSS, that younger nix readers only familiar with Linux may assume the were always this good!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, to the point of this post. Whilst checking some syntax earlier, I came across &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#non-capturing-and-named-groups">named groups&lt;/a>. I've never really stopped to read about these before. Traditionally (and in most code I come across), groups matched in regexes are captured with ( and ), and then &amp;quot;replayed&amp;quot; with $1, $2 (or \1 or \2 for sed, etc). This is fine when you're only trying to match 1 or 2 groups. But what happens when you have a hideously complicated match with 10+ matches. Editing and maintaining this is nightmare and fraught with problems. This is where named groups come in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How named groups work is best illustrated with a very simple example. Imagine a file like this, that is used to set shell variables that a command line utility picks up from the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">export&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">DBSERVER&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>dbserver.example.com
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">export&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">DBPORT&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">2000&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">export&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">CITY&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>London
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">export&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">COUNTRY&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>UK
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now imagine I need to write a python app that needs to use those same variables without duplicating them in a second config file. An easy way to do this would be with the following code using normal numbered groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span class="ln"> 1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span>

&lt;span class="ln">16&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">print&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">settings&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Running this gives you a dictionary with a key for each shell variable that was read in:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span>

&lt;span class="ln">6&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Switching to named groups, the functionally equivalent code could be written like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is just an example. You probably don't &lt;strong>need&lt;/strong> to use named groups in this instance and there is probably a config file parsing module anyway, but it' a good illustration on named groups and numbered groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now my last thought on the matter is that I wonder if the reason I've never come across or used named groups before is because if I'm matching a hideously long string into more than half a dozen groups, I'd probably tackle the problem in another way (read more simple and readable) such as breaking the string down with split, etc. Regular expressions are great, but the complicated ones don't contribute well to code maintainability.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting VIM Powerline Working with Putty</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/09/09/getting-vim-powerline-working-with-putty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2013 22:06:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/09/09/getting-vim-powerline-working-with-putty/</guid><description>
&lt;p>After using vim and vi for more years than I care to remember, I came across the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">vim powerline plugin&lt;/a> for the first time today. What an excellent vim statusline, and now I've been using it myself, I can see why it's so popular (that's a relative term - as in popular for a vim extensions! )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the &lt;a href="https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#installation-linux">installation documentation&lt;/a>, and thanks to &lt;a href="Pathogen">Pathogen&lt;/a> it was very straight forward to setup. After installation in my bundle directory, I simply switched Putty to UTF-8 and then added the following lines to my .vimrc&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">set&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">rtp&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">+=&lt;/span>~/.vim/bundle/powerline/powerline/bindings/vim
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">set&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">encoding&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>utf-8
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">set&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nv">laststatus&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="m">2&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>..and then it was all working nicely in Linux gnome-terminal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, when I came to using the same setup with Putty from Windows 7 machine (I have no choice, the firm I work for doesn't allow connection of a non-firm owned device to the network, so no connecting my Mac or Linux laptop here!), the character set was all screwed up. This is because powerline uses custom glyphs in the status bar and the MS Win 7 supplied Consolas font doesn't include those glyphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, my Win 7 machine doesn't have a full development environment, so &lt;a href="https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html">fontpatching&lt;/a> the Consolas font I use (as instructed to do in Linux/Mac OS X) was not an [easy] option. Luckily, I found there were already Consolas patched fonts around other people had made available. I first tried &lt;a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts/blob/master/Inconsolata/Inconsolata%20for%20Powerline.otf">Inconsolata for Powerline&lt;/a> as this was what's in the powerline repo and what the server and my Linux workstation used, but though fine in Linux, that just didn't look pretty in Putty. Next, I found posts referencing these &lt;a href="https://github.com/eugeneching/consolas-powerline-vim">patched Consolas&lt;/a> fonts, but after installation, it still wasn't displaying the correct characters. Being a bit of a vim plugin amateur, I checked and double-checked settings but to no avail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I came across some comments about the new (rewritten in Python) powerline plugin not using the same codes as the old powerline. By this time, I just wanted it working. This was one of those slight 10min deviations that was making me forget what I was originally doing. Enter cut and paste and the perl one-liner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used charmap to lookup the UTF-8 character codes, and then printed them to the terminal. Yippee! This at least confirmed my terminal, fonts and putty were correctly setup to display the characters, so the problem wasn't in either of these areas. So I looked at the default powerline config.json, and confirmed that it wasn't displaying the characters I was expecting to see. So next I &lt;a href="https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html">configured a local config.json&lt;/a>
and simply cut and paste the characters output from the perl one-liner and pasted them into the config.json in my home directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And voila...a working vim powerline plugin on Linux from Putty on Win7. Now I know this is not the right solution, and normally curiosity would force me get to the bottom of this and understand what was wrong, but having already spent an hr reading about the plugin and comments and dead ends refering to the old non-python version of the plugin, this got me a working powerline in Windows and so I'm happy with that. I just had to have those cute triangles in my menu bar - and no, ugly chars was not an option :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting SyntaxHighlighter to display these glyphs is certainly not something I want to spend 2 minutes investigating at the moment, so instead a screenshot of the perl one-liner and the changes to config.json:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Quick and easy way to show that UTF-8 is configured correctly in shell and terminal emulator is to display the Euro symbol. If you don't see the Euro symbol, then UTF-8 is not configured correctly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Normally my development environment lives on my nicely configured workstation. However, sometimes you're on a server, with no certificate chain installed for verification and behind a corporate firewall where git protocol is blocked and not permitted. If you just want to get at the code, using the https url to the git repository and turning off certificate verification can get you the code quickly. I found the following git config items helpful in this situation:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>git config --global http.proxy https://proxy.mycompany.com:8080/
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>git config --global https.sslVerify&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nb">false&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It is indeed not good practice to get accustomed to ignoring certs, but on this repo the cert had expired in any case, so it was a moot point. Whilst troubleshooting this issue, I also found the useful GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 environment variable that can be set to show curl interactions git is doing under the covers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SimpleHTTPServer</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/08/16/whilst-reading-about-basehttpserver/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2013 17:59:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2013/08/16/whilst-reading-about-basehttpserver/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Whilst reading about &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/basehttpserver.html">BaseHTTPServer&lt;/a> class as mentioned in the last post, I also came across the very useful &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html">SimpleHTTPserver&lt;/a> which is most definitely worth recording as a one-liner. Everybody must have come across the situation where you're ssh'd into a headless server with no Apache installed or running on it, and you come across an HTML file you want to look at. You can read it with vi (or lynx!) but that's never really going to be that nice. As python is near-ubiquitous on all Linux installations these days, you can run this simple oneliner to view HTML docs on the system (or in fact any files you might want to view graphically instead of via a terminal?)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These last few days I have been writing a command line reporting program at work. For Linux techs, formatted terminal output works great and is actually their preferred view. However, for managers, you simple must have the eye candy of a GUI. Normally in these situations, I would simply add CGI code and then bundle a simple Apache config to &lt;em>Include&lt;/em> along with the code. With this particular program, it could be run on any one of tens of thousands of servers we have, however it is only likely to be run for a short while to graphically review some data stored in JSON files on the server. The overhead of reconfiguring and restarting Apache, even though only a few commands, is probably too much in this particular scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/basehttpserver.html">BaseHTTPServer&lt;/a>. This includes classes that let your program become the webserver itself, negating the need to run a CGI script or framework under full blown Apache.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I work in a firm with 10s of 1000s of Linux servers. A colleague had been emailed a list of servers and was trying to find out who owned them. At first, I suggested running last to see who last logged in but we realised this probably wasn't the best way to start the hunt. On reflection, the was a high chance that the user who logged in the &lt;em>most&lt;/em> frequently into the server, was the the owner of that server. Or if not, he would most likely know the owner ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I used this 30 second one liner (wrapped for viewability) to list most frequent users:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;span class="ln"> 3&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">{ print &amp;#34;$u logged in $users{$u} times&amp;#34;; } }&amp;#39;&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Memory not as good as it used to be. Need to stop recording things in text files in my homedir and put them here where I can find them next time. Hopefully they may help you too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remote XDMCP Connection to GDM</title><link>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2011/04/27/remote-xdmcp-connection-to-gdm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2010 21:16:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://purplecarrot.co.uk/2011/04/27/remote-xdmcp-connection-to-gdm/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I always forget how to do this. And it always takes me ages to find out what I did last time. Edit /etc/gdm/custom.conf and add:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="k">[xdmcp]&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>&lt;span class="na">enable&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">true&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>&lt;span class="k">[greeter]&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span>&lt;span class="na">RemoteGreeter&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">/usr/libexec/gdmgreeter&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div></description></item></channel></rss>
